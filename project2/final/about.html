<p>ABOUT <strong>26FACE</strong><br><br>
</p>
<div>This is a typeface that communicates with people. Every charater has its own personality and its own story. As a group, all letters speaks to each other. When a character appears more frequent than others, it will influence others. 
<br><br>Pay attention to what the charater says, and accept that you are not able to learn everything about this typeface.
