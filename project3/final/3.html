		<span class="exTitle">about:</span> <br>This is an online exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg’s <i>White Paintings</i> (1951), which consists of a different number of modular panels. There are 1/2/3/4/7 panel iterations, and all the paintings have been painted completely white. In each case, Rauschenberg’s primary aim was to create a painting that looked untouched by human hands, as though it had simply arrived in the world fully formed and absolutely pure. Rauschenberg viewed them primarily as a concept and allowed for the physical artworks to be repainted and even refabricated from scratch without his direct involvement.<br><span class="tip">Double click the panel to navigate.</span>

					This one is believed to have been executed by Marden in 1968 while he was working as Rauschenberg’s studio assistant. It was subsequently repainted at least once, by Pottorf in 1998, while it was traveling in the Rauschenberg retrospective organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.
