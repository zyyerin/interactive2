		<span class="exTitle">about:</span> <br>This is an online exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg’s <i>White Paintings</i> (1951), which consists of a different number of modular panels. There are 1/2/3/4/7 panel iterations, and all the paintings have been painted completely white. In each case, Rauschenberg’s primary aim was to create a painting that looked untouched by human hands, as though it had simply arrived in the world fully formed and absolutely pure. Rauschenberg viewed them primarily as a concept and allowed for the physical artworks to be repainted and even refabricated from scratch without his direct involvement.<br><span class="tip">Double click the panel to navigate.</span>

				<div class="text5 text">In 1961, composer John Cage referred to the White Paintings as airports for lights, shadows, and particles, establishing an enduring understanding of the series as receptive surfaces that respond to the world around them.</div>

				<div class="text5 text">Building on this reading, Rauschenberg once referred to the works as clocks, saying that if one were sensitive enough to the subtle changes on their surfaces one could tell what time it was and what the weather was like outside.</div>

				<div class="text5 text"> Ultimately, the power of the White Paintings lies in the shifts in attention they require from the viewer, asking us to slow down, watch closely over time, and inspect their mute painted surfaces for subtle shifts in color, light, and texture.</div>
