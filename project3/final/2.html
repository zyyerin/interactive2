		<span class="exTitle">about:</span> <br>This is an online exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg’s <i>White Paintings</i> (1951), which consists of a different number of modular panels. There are 1/2/3/4/7 panel iterations, and all the paintings have been painted completely white. In each case, Rauschenberg’s primary aim was to create a painting that looked untouched by human hands, as though it had simply arrived in the world fully formed and absolutely pure. Rauschenberg viewed them primarily as a concept and allowed for the physical artworks to be repainted and even refabricated from scratch without his direct involvement.<br><span class="tip">Double click the panel to navigate.</span>
