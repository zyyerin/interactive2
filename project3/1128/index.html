	<div class="about">"A canvas is never empty."<br><br>
	Robert Rauschenberg’s <i>White Paintings</i> (1951) consists of a different number of modular panels—there are 1/2/3/4/7 panel iterations—that have been painted completely white. In each case, Rauschenberg’s primary aim was to create a painting that looked untouched by human hands, as though it had simply arrived in the world fully formed and absolutely pure. Rauschenberg viewed them primarily as a concept and allowed for the physical artworks to be repainted and even refabricated from scratch without his direct involvement.
